# Texture Mapping
Different material has differing surface properties; texture mapping is used to effciently emulate those properties as they would IRL.

## Image Tiles
Repeating textures result in visible artifacts
One possible solution is to use image tiles, which are images that are repeated in a grid pattern to create a seamless texture.

## Barycentric Coordinates
Barycentric coordinates are a way to represent a point in a triangle in terms of the triangle's vertices.

## Environment Maps

## Displacement Maps
Make things look 3d

## Bump Maps
Texture stores perturbation to surface normal
